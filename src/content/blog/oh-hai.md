I feel like "oh hai" was the millenial "Hello World" that never was...

Anyway - hello there, thank you for being here. This is my new home page complete with blog which I'm going to use to:

- Keep myself accountable whilst pursuing some goals (building in public, finding a job, that sort of thing...)
- Spread some learnings
- Use as a blatant tool for self promotion

That handsome chap up there? Looks nothing like me. That was an _attempt_ at using midjourney to generate a generic cartoon-esque image that might pass as me (I need to learn to generate images) but here we are - this is what came out of it and I needed an image so here we are. The first documentation of a failure.

More to come.
